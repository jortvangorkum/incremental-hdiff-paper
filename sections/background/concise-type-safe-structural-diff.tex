\subsection{Concise, Type-Safe, and Efficient Structural Diffing}

The paper \textit{Concise, Type-Safe, and Efficient Structural Diffing} written by Erdweg, Sebastian and Szab{\'o}, Tam{\'a}s and Pacak, Andr{\'e} presents a structural diffing algorithm called \textit{truediff}\cite{erdweg2021concise}. \textit{truediff} ensures that the patches produces are concise and type safe, and with a performance by an order of magnitude higher than Gumtree\cite{falleri2014gumtree} and the \textit{hdiff}\cite{miraldo2019efficient} algorithm.
