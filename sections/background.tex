\section{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the existing technology and literature that I'll be studying/using in my research
    \item hdiff weaknesses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One of the inefficiencies is that the patch is equal to the tree size
        \item To determine the diff the complete tree needs to be scanned, even for a small change
    \end{itemize}
    \item truediff weaknesses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the paper there are no experiments on automatically resolving conflicts
    \end{itemize}
