\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\Alph*)}]
    \item A library needs to be implemented which contains the generic \texttt{merkle}, \texttt{cataMerkle} and \texttt{cataMerkleWithMap} functions
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Questions}
Using the previously mentioned library, there is a multitude of questions to be answered:
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\Alph*)}]
    \item What parameters can be tweaked to have the best ratio of performance and memory usage?
    \item What type of equivalence is needed to reuse the incremental computation?
    \item What type of data structures are the best for storing the incremental computation?
    \item Could the library be used to perform static analysis in a more performant manner?
\end{enumerate}
